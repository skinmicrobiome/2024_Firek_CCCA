# Firek_CCCA_2024

R codes to generate Figure 1A-1C, Figure 2, and eFigure 2. The scripts requires the following files:
* bracken_genus.biom
* data_files/all_ccca_data.csv

Figure1.Rmd
* Figure 1A displays a stacked bar plot showing the relative abundance of different taxa across sample sites and cohorts.
* Figure 1B displays a PCoA plot for the vertex scalp site, colored by cohort.
* Figure 1C displays a PCoA plot for the occipital scalp site, colored by cohort.

Figure2.Rmd
* Figure 2A displays boxplots of relative abundances of Corynebacterium for the vertex scalp site, grouped by cohort.
* Figure 2B was generated using the Interactive Tree of Life (iTOL) tool (https://itol.embl.de/) and the dataset file data_files/dataset_heatmap_template.txt.

eFigure2.Rmd
* eFigure 2 displays boxplots of relative abundances of Lawsonella for the vertex scalp site, grouped by cohort.
