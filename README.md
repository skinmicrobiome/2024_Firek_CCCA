# Firek_CCCA_2024

R code to generate Figure 1A-1C. Code is divided into Figure 1A, Figure 1B, and Figure 1C.

Script uses the following files:

1. bracken_genus.biom
2. all_ccca_data.csv

Figure 1A generates a stacked bar plot showing the relative abundance of different taxa across sample sites and cohorts.

Figure 1B generates a PCoA plot for the vertex scalp site, colored by cohort.

Figure 1C generates a PCoA plot for the occipital scalp site, colored by cohort.

R code to generate Figure 2A for Corynebacterium boxplot.

Script uses the following files:
1. bracken_genus.biom
2. all_ccca_data.csv

Figure 2B was generated using the Interactive Tree of Life (iTOL) tool (https://itol.embl.de/) and the dataset file "dataset_heatmap_template.txt".

To recreate Figure 2B visit the iTOL website (https://itol.embl.de/) and upload the dataset file "dataset_heatmap_template.txt".

R code to generate eFigure 2 for Lawsonella boxplot. Script uses the following files: 1. bracken_genus.biom 2. all_ccca_data.csv
